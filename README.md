#MAJOR UPDATE!
switched to OpenSUSE!
new distro means new setup, so here I am!
changed background, bought new display, lots of big
updates coming at ya fast. the entire theme essetialy has been changed.
I did not keep the old one since i feel like that was merely an entry point
to ricing, now i'm starting to put thought into it and making it better.
next time I switch I will create a new project so that this theme stays.
hopefully you'll enjoy this one!

my i3-gaps dotfiles

my pc loves to go boom boom so this is here for next time lol
feel free to try this out though

My custom chrome greeter is a slightly customized theme from a project called nightTab (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nighttab/hdpcadigjkbcpnlcpbcohpafiaefanki)
highly reccomended for customizing chromium and chromium based browsers :)
